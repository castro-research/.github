# About

I have been diligently developing a proof of concept aimed at enhancing decision-making within both my projects and my workplace. 

My approach involves meticulously documenting the building process and outlining the steps I take to grasp various approaches, complete with a thorough analysis of the associated trade-offs.

This repository is dedicated to maintaining a clear distinction between the chronological account of my research endeavors and more casual pursuits such as personal notes, experimental projects, and recreational explorations.

In my continuous pursuit of refining decision-making processes in both my project undertakings and professional sphere, I have invested significant effort into crafting a robust proof of concept. Through this endeavor, I have embraced a meticulous approach that involves not only the construction phase but also a comprehensive breakdown of the methods I employ to comprehend diverse approaches. This encompasses a detailed exploration of the inherent trade-offs that each approach entails.

With an unwavering commitment to clarity and organization, I have established this repository as a dedicated space. Its primary purpose is to delineate the distinct narratives of my research progression from the more informal aspects of my intellectual journey. Within this repository, you'll find a clear demarcation between the historical trajectory of my rigorous research pursuits and the realm of playful personal notes, experimental forays, and the testing of various concepts.

This separation not only facilitates a streamlined comprehension of my professional evolution but also affords me the freedom to explore innovative ideas without the constraints of formal documentation. Through this repository, I aim to maintain a structured record of my intellectual growth while embracing the spontaneity that fuels creativity.
